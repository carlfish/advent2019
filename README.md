# [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Maybe I'll stick with it this year, who knows.

## Notes

I'm not here to play golf. Finding the shortest, cleverest answer isn't as much a priority as writing clear
code that, if I come back to it later, still tells me what problem it is solving. Hence types over tuples,
avoiding long chains of combinators, and sticking with attoparsec to decode even trivial input.
